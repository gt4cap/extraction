# extraction
Extraction code, public release. 2023-05-25.

This is the numba accelerated code that works with rasterized parcel features and mounted /eodata access.

Extraction scripts can be executed from a python_on_whales wrapper which monitors presence of ingested image candidates.

This code was extensively used during Outreach 2021 and is kind of robust. It may be pushed to the public ec-jrc/cbm repository at a later stage.
