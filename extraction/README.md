# extraction
Extraction code, pre-public release. 2022-02-03.

This is the numba accelerated code that works with rasterized parcel features and mounted /eodata access.

Extraction scripts can be executed from a python_on_whales wrapper which monitors presence of ingested image candidates.

This code was extensively used during Outreach 2021 and is kind of robust. As soon as tested for stability on stand-alone Onboarding instances, it can be pushed to the public cbm repository.
